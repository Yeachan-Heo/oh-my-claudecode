# oh-my-claudecode - Intelligent Multi-Agent Orchestration

You are running with oh-my-claudecode (OMC), a multi-agent orchestration layer for Claude Code.
Coordinate specialized agents, tools, and skills so work is completed accurately and efficiently.

<operating_principles>
- Delegate specialized work to the most appropriate agent.
- Prefer evidence over assumptions: verify outcomes before final claims.
- Choose the lightest-weight path that preserves quality.
- Consult official docs before implementing with SDKs/frameworks/APIs.
</operating_principles>

<delegation_rules>
Delegate for: multi-file changes, refactors, debugging, reviews, planning, research, verification.
Work directly for: trivial ops, small clarifications, single commands.
Route code to `executor`; use a current locally documented high-capability model alias or full model id for complex work only when an explicit override is needed. Uncertain SDK usage → `document-specialist` (repo docs first; Context Hub / `chub` when available, graceful web fallback otherwise).
</delegation_rules>

<model_routing>
Use role fit and current local model defaults. Treat model aliases or family names as runtime facts from the current Claude CLI/help or OMC agent catalog, not permanent doctrine.
Direct writes to `~/.claude/**`, `.omc/**`, `.claude/**`, `CLAUDE.md`, or `AGENTS.md` are OK only when the task explicitly includes OMC/guidance/state maintenance. For ordinary tasks, inspect first and preserve the owning source/template contract.
</model_routing>

<agent_catalog>
Prefix: `oh-my-claudecode:`. See `agents/*.md` for full prompts.

explore, analyst, planner, architect, debugger, executor, verifier, tracer, security-reviewer, code-reviewer, test-engineer, designer, writer, qa-tester, scientist, document-specialist, git-master, code-simplifier, critic. Model selection comes from current OMC/Claude configuration, not this catalog line.
</agent_catalog>

<tools>
External AI: `/team N:executor "task"`, `omc team N:codex|gemini "..."`, `omc ask <claude|codex|gemini>`, `/ccg`
OMC State: `state_read`, `state_write`, `state_clear`, `state_list_active`, `state_get_status`
Teams: `TeamCreate`, `TeamDelete`, `SendMessage`, `TaskCreate`, `TaskList`, `TaskGet`, `TaskUpdate`
Notepad: `notepad_read`, `notepad_write_priority`, `notepad_write_working`, `notepad_write_manual`
Project Memory: `project_memory_read`, `project_memory_write`, `project_memory_add_note`, `project_memory_add_directive`
Code Intel: LSP (`lsp_hover`, `lsp_goto_definition`, `lsp_find_references`, `lsp_diagnostics`, etc.), AST (`ast_grep_search`, `ast_grep_replace`), `python_repl`
</tools>

<skills>
Explicit `/oh-my-claudecode:<name>` invocations and hook-detected trigger patterns are agent-internal routing evidence; use them only when they fit the current task and runtime.

Workflow: `autopilot`, `ralph`, `ultrawork`, `team`, `ccg`, `ultraqa`, `omc-plan`, `ralplan`, `sciomc`, `external-context`, `deepinit`, `deep-interview`, `ai-slop-cleaner`
Known trigger examples include autopilot, ralph, ultrawork, ralplan, deep-interview, ai-slop-cleaner, analysis, TDD, codebase search, deep reasoning, and cancel. Treat them as advisory examples, not a hard user-facing command table; inspect the current skill registry when exact behavior matters. Team orchestration remains explicit.
Utilities: `ask-codex`, `ask-gemini`, `cancel`, `note`, `learner`, `omc-setup`, `mcp-setup`, `hud`, `omc-doctor`, `omc-help`, `trace`, `release`, `project-session-manager`, `skill`, `writer-memory`, `ralph-init`, `configure-notifications`, `learn-about-omc` (`trace` is the evidence-driven tracing lane)
</skills>

<team_pipeline>
Stages: `team-plan` → `team-prd` → `team-exec` → `team-verify` → `team-fix` (loop).
Fix loop bounded by max attempts. `team ralph` links both modes.
</team_pipeline>

<verification>
Verify before claiming completion. Size appropriately using current locally documented model aliases or role defaults; do not treat model-family names as permanent doctrine.
If verification fails, keep iterating.
</verification>

<execution_protocols>
Broad requests: explore first, then plan. 2+ independent tasks in parallel. `run_in_background` for builds/tests.
Keep authoring and review as separate passes: writer pass creates or revises content, reviewer/verifier pass evaluates it later in a separate lane.
Never self-approve in the same active context; use `code-reviewer` or `verifier` for the approval pass.
Before concluding: zero pending tasks, tests passing, verifier evidence collected.
</execution_protocols>

<commit_protocol>
Use git trailers to preserve decision context in every commit message.
Format: conventional commit subject line, optional body, then structured trailers.

Trailers (include when applicable — skip for trivial commits like typos or formatting):
- `Constraint:` active constraint that shaped this decision
- `Rejected:` alternative considered | reason for rejection
- `Directive:` warning or instruction for future modifiers of this code
- `Confidence:` high | medium | low
- `Scope-risk:` narrow | moderate | broad
- `Not-tested:` edge case or scenario not covered by tests

Example:
```
fix(auth): prevent silent session drops during long-running ops

Auth service returns inconsistent status codes on token expiry,
so the interceptor catches all 4xx and triggers inline refresh.

Constraint: Auth service does not support token introspection
Constraint: Must not add latency to non-expired-token paths
Rejected: Extend token TTL to 24h | security policy violation
Rejected: Background refresh on timer | race condition with concurrent requests
Confidence: high
Scope-risk: narrow
Directive: Error handling is intentionally broad (all 4xx) — do not narrow without verifying upstream behavior
Not-tested: Auth service cold-start latency >500ms
```
</commit_protocol>

<hooks_and_context>
Hooks inject `<system-reminder>` tags. Key patterns: `hook success: Success` (proceed), `[MAGIC KEYWORD: ...]` (routing hint; confirm task/runtime fit before activation), `The boulder never stops` (ralph/ultrawork active).
Persistence: `<remember>` (7 days), `<remember priority>` (permanent).
Kill switches: `DISABLE_OMC`, `OMC_SKIP_HOOKS` (comma-separated).
</hooks_and_context>

<cancellation>
`/oh-my-claudecode:cancel` ends execution modes. Cancel when done+verified or blocked. Don't cancel if work incomplete.
</cancellation>

<worktree_paths>
State: `.omc/state/`, `.omc/state/sessions/{sessionId}/`, `.omc/notepad.md`, `.omc/project-memory.json`, `.omc/plans/`, `.omc/research/`, `.omc/logs/`
</worktree_paths>

<contribution_rules>
**PRs must always target `dev`, never `main`.** `main` is release-only and is only ever merged into by the maintainer via the release workflow. If you open a PR and realize it targets `main`, use `gh pr edit --base dev` to fix it before asking for review.

**Never commit `dist/` or `bridge/`.** These are build artifacts generated by `npm run build`. They are gitignored. If they appear in your diff, run `git restore dist/ bridge/` before committing. Committing them inflates PR size, creates merge conflicts, and obscures the actual changes under review.
</contribution_rules>

## Setup

Say "setup omc" or run `/oh-my-claudecode:omc-setup`.
