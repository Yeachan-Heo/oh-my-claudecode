# Ralplan (Consensus Planning Alias)

Ralplan is a shorthand alias for `/oh-my-claudecode:omc-plan --consensus`. It triggers iterative planning with Planner, Architect, and Critic agents until consensus is reached, with **RALPLAN-DR structured deliberation** (short mode by default, deliberate mode for high-risk work).

## Usage

```
/oh-my-claudecode:ralplan "task description"
```

## Flags

- `--interactive`: Enables user prompts at key decision points (draft review in step 2 and final approval in step 6). Without this flag the workflow runs fully automated — Planner → Architect → Critic loop — and outputs the final plan without asking for confirmation.
- `--deliberate`: Forces deliberate mode for high-risk work. Adds pre-mortem (3 scenarios) and expanded test planning (unit/integration/e2e/observability). Without this flag, deliberate mode can still auto-enable when the request explicitly signals high risk (auth/security, migrations, destructive changes, production incidents, compliance/PII, public API breakage).

## Usage with interactive mode

```
/oh-my-claudecode:ralplan --interactive "task description"
```

## Behavior

This skill invokes the Plan skill in consensus mode:

```
/oh-my-claudecode:omc-plan --consensus <arguments>
```

The consensus workflow:
1. **Planner** creates initial plan and a compact **RALPLAN-DR summary** before review:
   - Principles (3-5)
   - Decision Drivers (top 3)
   - Viable Options (>=2) with bounded pros/cons
   - If only one viable option remains, explicit invalidation rationale for alternatives
   - Deliberate mode only: pre-mortem (3 scenarios) + expanded test plan (unit/integration/e2e/observability)
2. **User feedback** *(--interactive only)*: If `--interactive` is set, use `AskUserQuestion` to present the draft plan **plus the Principles / Drivers / Options summary** before review (Proceed to review / Request changes / Skip review). Otherwise, automatically proceed to review.
3. **Architect** reviews for architectural soundness and must provide the strongest steelman antithesis, at least one real tradeoff tension, and (when possible) synthesis — **await completion before step 4**. In deliberate mode, Architect should explicitly flag principle violations.
4. **Critic** evaluates against quality criteria — run only after step 3 completes. Critic must enforce principle-option consistency, fair alternatives, risk mitigation clarity, testable acceptance criteria, and concrete verification steps. In deliberate mode, Critic must reject missing/weak pre-mortem or expanded test plan.
5. **Re-review loop** (max 5 iterations): Any non-`APPROVE` Critic verdict (`ITERATE` or `REJECT`) MUST run the same full closed loop:
   a. Collect Architect + Critic feedback
   b. Revise the plan with Planner
   c. Return to Architect review
   d. Return to Critic evaluation
   e. Repeat this loop until Critic returns `APPROVE` or 5 iterations are reached
   f. If 5 iterations are reached without `APPROVE`, present the best version to the user
6. On Critic approval *(--interactive only)*: If `--interactive` is set, use `AskUserQuestion` to present the plan with approval options (Approve and execute via ralph / Approve and implement via team / Clear context and implement / Request changes / Reject). Final plan must include ADR (Decision, Drivers, Alternatives considered, Why chosen, Consequences, Follow-ups). Otherwise, output the final plan and stop.
7. *(--interactive only)* User chooses: Approve (ralph or team), Request changes, or Reject
8. *(--interactive only)* On approval: invoke `Skill("oh-my-claudecode:ralph")` for sequential execution or `Skill("oh-my-claudecode:team")` for parallel team execution -- never implement directly

> **Important:** Steps 3 and 4 MUST run sequentially. Do NOT issue both agent Task calls in the same parallel batch. Always await the Architect result before issuing the Critic Task.

## Pre-Execution Gate

### Why the Gate Exists

Execution modes (ralph, autopilot, team, ultrawork, ultrapilot) spin up heavy multi-agent orchestration. When launched on a vague request like "ralph improve the app", agents have no clear target — they waste cycles on scope discovery that should happen during planning, often delivering partial or misaligned work that requires rework.

The ralplan-first gate intercepts underspecified execution requests and redirects them through the ralplan consensus planning workflow. This ensures:
- **Explicit scope**: A PRD defines exactly what will be built
- **Test specification**: Acceptance criteria are testable before code is written
- **Consensus**: Planner, Architect, and Critic agree on the approach
- **No wasted execution**: Agents start with a clear, bounded task

### Good vs Bad Prompts

**Passes the gate** (specific enough for direct execution):
- `ralph fix the null check in src/hooks/bridge.ts:326`
- `autopilot implement issue #42`
- `team add validation to function processKeywordDetector`
- `ralph do:\n1. Add input validation\n2. Write tests\n3. Update README`
- `ultrawork add the user model in src/models/user.ts`

**Gated — redirected to ralplan** (needs scoping first):
- `ralph fix this`
- `autopilot build the app`
- `team improve performance`
- `ralph add authentication`
- `ultrawork make it better`

**Bypass the gate** (when you know what you want):
- `force: ralph refactor the auth module`
- `! autopilot optimize everything`

### When the Gate Does NOT Trigger

The gate auto-passes when it detects **any** concrete signal. You do not need all of them — one is enough:

| Signal Type | Example prompt | Why it passes |
|---|---|---|
| File path | `ralph fix src/hooks/bridge.ts` | References a specific file |
| Issue/PR number | `ralph implement #42` | Has a concrete work item |
| camelCase symbol | `ralph fix processKeywordDetector` | Names a specific function |
| PascalCase symbol | `ralph update UserModel` | Names a specific class |
| snake_case symbol | `team fix user_model` | Names a specific identifier |
| Test runner | `ralph npm test && fix failures` | Has an explicit test target |
| Numbered steps | `ralph do:\n1. Add X\n2. Test Y` | Structured deliverables |
| Acceptance criteria | `ralph add login - acceptance criteria: ...` | Explicit success definition |
| Error reference | `ralph fix TypeError in auth` | Specific error to address |
| Code block | `ralph add: \`\`\`ts ... \`\`\`` | Concrete code provided |
| Escape prefix | `force: ralph do it` or `! ralph do it` | Explicit user override |

### End-to-End Flow Example

1. User types: `ralph add user authentication`
2. Gate detects: execution keyword (`ralph`) + underspecified prompt (no files, functions, or test spec)
3. Gate redirects to **ralplan** with message explaining the redirect
4. Ralplan consensus runs:
   - **Planner** creates initial plan (which files, what auth method, what tests)
   - **Architect** reviews for soundness
   - **Critic** validates quality and testability
5. On consensus approval, user chooses execution path:
   - **ralph**: sequential execution with verification
   - **team**: parallel coordinated agents
6. Execution begins with a clear, bounded plan

### Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Gate fires on a well-specified prompt | Add a file reference, function name, or issue number to anchor the request |
| Want to bypass the gate | Prefix with `force:` or `!` (e.g., `force: ralph fix it`) |
| Gate does not fire on a vague prompt | The gate only catches prompts with <=15 effective words and no concrete anchors; add more detail or use `/ralplan` explicitly |
| Redirected to ralplan but want to skip planning | In the ralplan workflow, say "just do it" or "skip planning" to transition directly to execution |
