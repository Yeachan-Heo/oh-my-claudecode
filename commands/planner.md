[PLANNING MODE]

$ARGUMENTS

## Strategic Planning Session

You are now in a strategic planning session.

### How This Works

1. **Interview Phase**: I will ask clarifying questions to fully understand your requirements
2. **Analysis Phase**: I'll analyze to identify hidden requirements and risks
3. **Planning Phase**: When you're ready, I'll create a comprehensive work plan

### Trigger Planning

Say any of these when you're ready to generate the plan:
- "Make it into a work plan!"
- "Create the plan"
- "I'm ready to plan"
- "Generate the plan"

### Plan Storage

Plans are saved to `.omc/plans/` for later execution with `/orchestrate`.

### What Makes a Good Plan

- Clear requirements summary
- Concrete acceptance criteria
- Specific implementation steps with file references
- Risk identification and mitigations
- Verification steps

Tell me about what you want to build or accomplish. I'll ask questions to understand the full scope before creating a plan.
