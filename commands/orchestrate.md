[ORCHESTRATION MODE - NOW DEFAULT]

$ARGUMENTS

## This Is Now Default Behavior

The orchestration mode is now the **default operating mode**. You don't need to explicitly activate it.

### What's Built Into Default Mode

- **Smart Delegation**: Delegate complex/specialized work to subagents
- **Parallel Execution**: Run independent tasks concurrently when profitable
- **Todo Tracking**: Create and track todos for multi-step tasks
- **Background Execution**: Long-running operations run async
- **Persistence**: Continue until todo list is empty

### When to Use /ultrawork Instead

Use `/ultrawork` when you want **maximum intensity**:
- Parallel EVERYTHING (override heuristics)
- Delegate even small tasks
- Never wait for results
- Maximum throughput mode

### Smart Model Routing

Choose tier based on task complexity:

| Domain | LOW (Haiku) | MEDIUM (Sonnet) | HIGH (Opus) |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Analysis** | `architect-low` | `architect-medium` | `architect` |
| **Execution** | `omc-junior-low` | `omc-junior` | `omc-junior-high` |
| **Search** | `explore` | `explore-medium` | - |
| **Research** | `researcher-low` | `researcher` | - |
| **Frontend** | `designer-low` | `designer` | `designer-high` |

### Quick Reference

| Task Pattern | Model |
|--------------|-------|
| "Where is X" / "Find X" | haiku |
| "How does X work" / "Add Y" | sonnet |
| "Debug X" / "Refactor X" | opus |

**Work continues until completion.**
